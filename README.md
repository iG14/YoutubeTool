* ## Free Proxy
   Try not to use free proxies. But if you have a paid subscription and you want to use authenticated IP feature, then you can use the free proxy category. Provide your text file path (where you saved the proxies) when the script asks for a proxy file name or a proxy API.
   N.B: Available for **http(s)/socks4/socks5**
   
* ## Premium Proxy
   Proxies with authentication can also be done. To do so put your proxies in this format `username:password@ipaddress:port`or `ipaddress:port:username:password` in a text file. Every single line will contain a single proxy. Provide your text file path when the script asks for a proxy file name or a proxy API.
   
   N.B: Only available for **http** type proxy.

* ## Rotating Proxy
   You can also use the rotating proxies service. You can either authenticate your IP on your proxy provider service and use `ipaddress:port` as Main Gateway. 
   N.B: Available for **http(s)/socks4/socks5**

   Or direct use username:password combo like this `username:password@ipaddress:port` or `ipaddress:port:username:password` as Main Gateway.

   N.B: Only available for **http** type proxy.
   You can use proxy API too.


   Search
  Program can search youtube with the keyword you want and find the video with video title or video id. To do this you need to know what keyword can find your video on youtube search engine. Also you need to provide **exact** video title or video id. Put keyword and title like this format `keyword :::: video title` or `keyword :::: video id` in **search.txt**. Always use multiple `keyword` for the same `video title` or `video id`.

  *If you don't know any keyword just put your `video title :::: video title` or `video title :::: video id` in search.txt*

   
# Live Stream
   This script supports live streams too. Just use this script as you would for the already uploaded video. Script will automatically know if your video is live. Just bear in mind, you need a **high-end pc** for higher threads to get more viewers.
   Basically, script will check every 60 secs if youtube shows `x watching now` is present. If your live stream ends, script will check 5 times to be sure. In another word, after your live stream ends, script takes 5 minutes to close the driver.
   
   If you have never used this script before, use this first for an already uploaded video. This way, you will have a better understanding of how this script works. To do so, keep reading.

# YouTube Music
   Can generate views on YouTube Music too. In **urls.txt** put your music link like this `https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxx`. Script will automatically load YouTube Music when it sees link have `music.youtube.com`. **Search feature is not available for this.** So you need to empty the search.txt otherwise it will start searching videos in default YouTube.
